# HTTP Basics

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is used for communication between a client (browser) and a server.

## What is a Request?
A request is sent by the client to the server.

Example:
GET /index.html

## What is a Response?
A response is sent by the server back to the client.

Example:
200 OK

Why Blue Team cares:
Understanding HTTP helps in analyzing web traffic and detecting suspicious activity.
