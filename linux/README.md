# Linux

This folder is dedicated to building strong Linux fundamentals as part of my SOC learning journey.

Linux is widely used in servers, cloud environments, and security tools. A solid understanding of Linux is essential for log analysis, incident investigation, and system-level monitoring in a SOC environment.

The purpose of this section is to:

- Understand basic and advanced Linux commands
- Learn file system structure and permissions
- Analyze system processes and services
- Practice real command-line usage
- Develop security-focused investigation skills

Each file in this folder documents practical learning, command usage, observations, and security relevance.
