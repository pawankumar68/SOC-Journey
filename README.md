## 🛠 Learning Philosophy

For every topic, I follow a structured approach:

1. Understand the core concept  
2. Practice using real commands or labs  
3. Analyze outputs and behavior  
4. Connect the topic to security use cases  
5. Document insights clearly  

This ensures practical understanding rather than memorization.
