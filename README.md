# Networking

This folder is created to build strong networking fundamentals as part of my journey to becoming a SOC Analyst (Blue Team).

Networking knowledge is essential in cybersecurity because every attack, log, alert, and investigation is related to how systems communicate over a network.

Through this folder, I am learning:

- How devices communicate over the internet
- How protocols like TCP/IP work
- How DNS and HTTP function
- How to analyze network-related activity
- How networking concepts connect to security monitoring

Each note inside this folder represents my practical and theoretical understanding of networking concepts.

Goal: Build a solid networking foundation required for log analysis, SIEM monitoring, and threat detection.
