## 🛠 Learning Method

For each topic, I follow a structured process:

1. Learn the core concept  
2. Practice commands or real examples  
3. Observe system behavior  
4. Connect learning to real-world security scenarios  
5. Document insights clearly  

This approach ensures deep understanding instead of memorization.
