# Networking

This folder is dedicated to building strong networking fundamentals as part of my SOC learning journey.

Understanding networking is essential in cybersecurity because every security event, alert, and investigation is connected to how systems communicate over a network.

The purpose of this section is to:

- Understand how data travels across networks
- Learn how protocols like TCP/IP work
- Study DNS and internet communication basics
- Practice networking commands
- Develop security-focused thinking around network activity

Each file in this folder represents structured learning combined with practical observations and SOC relevance.
